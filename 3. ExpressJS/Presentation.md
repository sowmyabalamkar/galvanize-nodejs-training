## Post Request Handling
Demo : postrequest/server.js

## Static Files
Demo: staticfiles/

## Scaffolding
    Scaffolding is creating the skeleton structure of application.
    It allows users to create own public directories, routes, views etc. Once the structure for app is built, user can start building it.
    
    npm install express-generator -g
